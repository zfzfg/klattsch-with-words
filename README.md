# klattsch (Text-to-Phoneme Edition)

A primitive parallel-formant speech synthesizer in the browser. Late-70s / early-80s tier (Votrax, SAM).

**This is a fork by [@zfzfg](https://github.com/zfzfg).** It adds full **English Text-to-Phoneme** support using the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary. You can type normal English words (like `hello world`) and the synthesizer will automatically convert them to the correct ARPABET phonemes under the hood.

[**Original Project**](https://github.com/tgies/klattsch) by Tony Gies.

## What it does

You can type normal English text, or a phoneme string in [ARPABET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPABET), with optional directives, and the computer says it.

```
hello world                       normal text, automatically translated
HH AH L OW                        hello in phonemes
b140 hello                        higher voice, mixed with text
bA3 HH AH L OW                    higher voice (note name)
```

See the in-app `syntax help` panel for the full directive table.

## Installation

```bash
npm install klattsch
```

The same package works as a CLI, as an importable engine in Node, and as an embeddable engine + AudioWorklet in the browser. Zero runtime dependencies.

## Usage

### CLI

Render a phoneme string straight to a WAV file:

```bash
npx klattsch "HH AH L OW" hello.wav
```

### Node / `OfflineAudioContext`

```js
import { compileString, FormantSynth, encodeWav } from 'klattsch';

const sampleRate = 48000;
const { schedule, totalMs } = compileString('HH AH L OW');
const synth = new FormantSynth({ sampleRate, schedule });
const buf = new Float32Array(Math.ceil(totalMs * sampleRate / 1000));
synth.process(buf);

const { bytes } = encodeWav(buf, sampleRate);
// write bytes to a .wav file
```

### Browser with a bundler (Vite, webpack, esbuild, Rollup)

```js
import { compileString } from 'klattsch';
import workletUrl from 'klattsch/formant-worklet.js?url';

const ctx = new AudioContext();
await ctx.audioWorklet.addModule(workletUrl);
const node = new AudioWorkletNode(ctx, 'formant-processor');
node.connect(ctx.destination);

const { schedule } = compileString('HH AH L OW');
node.port.postMessage({ type: 'schedule', schedule });
```

### Browser without a bundler (CDN)

```html
<script type="module">
  import { compileString } from 'https://esm.sh/klattsch';

  const ctx = new AudioContext();
  await ctx.audioWorklet.addModule('https://esm.sh/klattsch/formant-worklet.js');
  const node = new AudioWorkletNode(ctx, 'formant-processor');
  node.connect(ctx.destination);

  const { schedule } = compileString('HH AH L OW');
  node.port.postMessage({ type: 'schedule', schedule });
</script>
```

## How it works

- **Excitation:** voiced source is a Rosenberg-style glottal pulse with a tunable open / closed quotient (`g` / "effort") and unvoiced source is xorshift noise. These are crossfaded by each phoneme's `voicing` parameter, with optional aspiration noise mixed in.
- **Filtering:** three parallel bandpass biquads for each formant.
- **Prosody:** the sequencer compiles phoneme strings into a time-stamped schedule of formant targets.
- **Voice character:** vibrato (depth + rate), aspiration / breathiness, spectral tilt, and glottal effort are all controllable.

Where klattsch does parallel-formant *vocal-tract* synthesis, libadlmidi-js does FM-operator synthesis: the sound of early-80s arcade boards and AdLib cards. Includes [oplsfxr](https://libadlmidi-js.github.io/examples/oplsfxr.html), a sfxr-style sound effect generator.

## Built with klattsch

- [**klattsch-sing**](https://sing.wasthatzero.net/) - a piano-roll sequencer for speech-based singing synthesis. Draw notes, type words or phonemes, render to WAV. Supports MIDI import, quantization, tempo + time signature, demo songs, and a custom KSP project file format. Built on the klattsch npm package.

## Commercial Support

`klattsch` is built and maintained by [Tony Gies](https://github.com/tgies). For studios, indie developers, and agencies integrating klattsch into a shipped product, consulting is available through his consultancy, Crash United, LLC.
